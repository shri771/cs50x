Project Collection
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository holds a collection of projects that were initially coded as coursework at Harvard University. These projects were formerly hosted in a private repository at Harvard, which I don't have admin privileges to share. For the sake of consolidating my work, I have brought these projects over here.
